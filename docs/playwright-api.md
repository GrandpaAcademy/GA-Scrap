# üé≠ Complete Playwright API Access

<div align="center">

**Every Playwright Feature from A-Z**  
*Full control when you need it*

</div>

---

## üéØ Overview

GA-Scrap provides **complete access** to every Playwright feature through both sync and async interfaces. You get the best of both worlds: simple GA-Scrap methods for common tasks, and full Playwright power for advanced scenarios.

---

## üîÑ Access Methods

### 1. High-Level GA-Scrap Methods
*Perfect for most use cases*

```python
with SyncGAScrap() as scraper:
    scraper.goto("https://example.com")
    title = scraper.get_text("h1")
    scraper.screenshot("page.png")
```

### 2. Direct Playwright Object Access
*When you need specific Playwright features*

```python
with SyncGAScrap() as scraper:
    scraper.goto("https://example.com")
    
    # Get direct access to Playwright objects
    page = scraper.get_playwright_page()
    context = scraper.get_playwright_context()
    browser = scraper.get_playwright_browser()
    playwright = scraper.get_playwright_instance()
    
    # Use any Playwright method directly
    await page.evaluate("document.body.style.background = 'red'")
    cookies = await context.cookies()
    version = browser.version
```

### 3. Safe Method Execution
*Execute any Playwright method with error protection*

```python
with SyncGAScrap(sandbox_mode=True) as scraper:
    scraper.goto("https://example.com")
    
    # Execute any Playwright method safely
    title = scraper.execute_playwright_method('page', 'title')
    cookies = scraper.execute_playwright_method('context', 'cookies')
    version = scraper.execute_playwright_method('browser', 'version')
    
    # Helper methods for sync interface
    title = scraper.playwright_page_method('title')
    cookies = scraper.playwright_context_method('cookies')
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Safe Execution with Sandbox Mode

All Playwright methods can be executed safely with sandbox mode:

```python
with SyncGAScrap(sandbox_mode=True) as scraper:
    scraper.goto("https://example.com")
    
    # These won't crash even if they fail
    title = scraper.execute_playwright_method('page', 'title')
    cookies = scraper.execute_playwright_method('context', 'cookies')
    
    # Direct object access with error handling
    page = scraper.get_playwright_page()
    try:
        await page.click("#might-not-exist")
    except:
        pass  # Handle gracefully
```

## üéØ When to Use Each Approach

### üîÑ Use GA-Scrap Methods When:
- **Learning web scraping** - Simple, intuitive API
- **Common operations** - Navigation, clicking, text extraction
- **Quick prototyping** - Fast development cycles
- **Sandbox mode benefits** - Error-resilient development

### üé≠ Use Direct Playwright When:
- **Advanced features** - Specific Playwright capabilities
- **Performance optimization** - Direct control over operations
- **Complex interactions** - Multi-step, coordinated actions
- **Integration needs** - Existing Playwright code

### üõ°Ô∏è Use Safe Execution When:
- **Unknown websites** - Unpredictable page structures
- **Development phase** - Testing different approaches
- **Error handling** - Graceful failure recovery
- **Batch operations** - Processing multiple items

---

## üöÄ Examples

### Combining All Approaches
```python
with SyncGAScrap(sandbox_mode=True) as scraper:
    # High-level GA-Scrap method
    scraper.goto("https://example.com")
    
    # Direct Playwright access for advanced features
    page = scraper.get_playwright_page()
    await page.evaluate("document.body.style.background = 'linear-gradient(45deg, red, blue)'")
    
    # Safe method execution for risky operations
    title = scraper.execute_playwright_method('page', 'title')
    
    # Back to GA-Scrap for simplicity
    scraper.screenshot("final.png")
```

### Advanced Playwright Features
```python
with SyncGAScrap() as scraper:
    scraper.goto("https://example.com")
    
    # Get all Playwright objects
    page = scraper.get_playwright_page()
    context = scraper.get_playwright_context()
    browser = scraper.get_playwright_browser()
    
    # Use advanced Playwright features
    await page.expose_function("customFunction", lambda x: x.upper())
    await page.route("**/*.png", lambda route: route.abort())
    await context.grant_permissions(["geolocation", "camera"])
    
    # Execute custom JavaScript with exposed function
    result = await page.evaluate("customFunction('hello world')")
    print(result)  # "HELLO WORLD"
```
